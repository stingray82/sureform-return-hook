sureform-return-hook
====================

This is Work in progress, to show the output from a sureforms form below the
form without using flowmattic

 

-   Activates

-   Sends data to web-hook

-   send data to action

-   can receive and get data back from flow via a function;
    (build_flowmattic_response)

-   Admin menu to select forms set webhook or action (only one should be set per
    form)

 

TO DO: *I am not great at JS (So have had to use chatgpt)*

-   Javascript is blocking so responses can’t be shown

-   JS need to compare forms and only effect those within the admin area (get
    options) - *I had this working in the concept so this shouldn’t be too
    hard;*

-   Start appending the CSS classes that are native to sureforms to the output
    so its all stylable
